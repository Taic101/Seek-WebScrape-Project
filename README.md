# Seek-WebScrape-Project
A webscraping tool for Seek.co.nz to scrape job data for data analysis.

This script will not only scrape the data from seek.co.nz of the job type of your choosing, but put that data in a csv file on the users Desktop so the user may analyze the data further.

Right now, the script requires manual editing of values to change the results of the scrape.
